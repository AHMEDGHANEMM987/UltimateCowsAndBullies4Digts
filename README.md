Cows and Bullies - The Digital Guessing Game

Description:
Cows and Bullies is a digital version of the classic “Cows and Bulls” game, where players try to guess a secret 4-digit number based on feedback provided after each guess. The game is a fun and interactive way to test your logical thinking and deduction skills. It has been developed to be played on modern web browsers, making it accessible from anywhere on the internet. Players receive clues in the form of “Cows” and “Bullies” (or “Taureaux” and “Vaches” in French), which help them refine their guesses until they discover the secret number.

History:
The “Cows and Bulls” game has roots in early puzzle and guessing games, dating back to the 1970s with similar games like Mastermind. It was traditionally a pen-and-paper game, but as web technologies advanced, the idea of creating a digital version emerged. This digital version, “Cows and Bullies,” was developed to provide an accessible and engaging experience for players worldwide. The game was initially created in English and later expanded to support multiple languages, including German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic, to cater to a global audience.
